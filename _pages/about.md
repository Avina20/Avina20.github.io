I am a second year Master's student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) majoring in Computer Science with current GPA of 3.6. I have done my Bachelors from [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with 8.89 GPA.

I have 2 years work experience as Software Engineer (Backend) in an e-pharmacy startup called [PharmEasy](https://pharmeasy.in/). I have also interned as Research Intern (Image Processing) in [Indian Space Research Organization](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on the Normalization of satellite images. I have also interned in [Amilcar Technologies](https://www.amilcartek.com/) as Web Developer for 2 months where I was responsible for recreation of their official website. The details can be found in [CV](/cv/).

Apart from these, I have worked on a number of personal and academic projects. I have done projects on web development and app development. I really enjoyed learning and implementing Machine Learning models to solve interesting problems. I also skilled myself in Deep Learning techniques and developed projects using DL models, which really helped me in my ISRO internship as well. Recently I took part in the GenAI hackathon by Amazon in NY. I am also intrigued by NLP and have built projects on summarization and mcq generation. The details can be found in [Projects](/projects/).

I am really passionate about technology. I am really interested in exploring new developments, learning new skills and using those skills to build something creative and useful. I have always loved working in teams and have great communication skills.
